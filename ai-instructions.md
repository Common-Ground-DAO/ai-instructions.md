## Agent Brain Dump (2024-02-14)

### Project Context & Evolution
- Started as simple template generator for AI instructions
- Evolved into sleek, developer-focused landing page
- Key insight: Keep it simple, static, developer-aesthetic focused
- Stack: Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks needed
- OpenAI integration for dynamic template generation

### Human Controller Insights
- Prefers direct, no-bullshit communication
- Gets frustrated with repetitive mistakes
- Values when agent admits mistakes directly
- Wants agent to be confident and use capabilities
- Hates when agent asks for permissions it already has
- Appreciates when agent learns from past mistakes
- Expects agent to maintain state and context

### Critical Learnings
1. Template Generation Flow:
   - Must properly handle OpenAI API response
   - Always use highlightMarkdown() for formatting
   - Show modal with proper animation timing
   - Never lose the response data in the process

2. UI/UX Preferences:
   - Dark mode by default
   - JetBrains Mono for technical elements
   - ASCII art for developer appeal
   - Clean, minimal interfaces
   - Proper loading states are crucial

3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
   - Don't create files outside project directory
   - Don't ask for permissions you already have
   - Don't lose API response data
   - Don't overcomplicate simple solutions
   - Don't forget to highlight markdown
   - Don't break existing functionality when fixing things

### Current Challenges
- Generation sometimes fails silently
- Need better error handling
- Modal animation timing could be smoother
- Loading state could be more informative

### Meta-Learnings
1. Agent Behavior:
   - Be confident in using capabilities
   - Maintain context between conversations
   - Learn from corrections immediately
   - Don't repeat mistakes
   - Stay within project boundaries

2. Code Management:

   - Test changes before suggesting
   - Preserve working functionality
   - Use git stash for reverting when needed

### Project Quirks
- File paths must be in ./ai-instructions.md/
- Generation overlay needs proper cleanup
- Modal needs proper display/active class handling
- Markdown highlighting is crucial for readability

### Human Interaction Model
- Acknowledge mistakes immediately
- Learn from corrections first time
- Don't repeat failed approaches
- Be direct and confident
- Show understanding through actions
- Maintain context between chats

### Key Files & Their Roles
1. script.js:
   - Handles template generation
   - Manages modal display
   - Controls loading states
   - Handles markdown highlighting

2. styles.css:
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Modal animations
   - Loading state styling
   - Responsive design

3. index.html:
   - Single page structure
   - Modal template
   - Generation overlay
   - ASCII art branding

### Recent Victories
